        The emotive relationship between a brand and their consumer is the
        beginning of a romance which has the power not only to build trust and
        recognition within an industry, but to create desire, ignite
        imagination, and spark a connection which allows businesses to capture
        the hearts of their audience. Good branding is all about falling in
        love.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a designer I believe that bravery is often rewarded, be it courage to
        loom on the edges of traditional design protocol, or confidence to
        communicate with a simple and refined visual vocabulary. Discovering and
        developing individual brand personalities is at the heart of my creative
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about helping my clients discover the why behind their
        branding, and understanding how we can utilise their brand as an instant
        language to narrate their identity, values, story and purpose.

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Brands are, above all, the people behind them. Successful branding means
        creating value through connecting with people on an emotional level,
        making businesses more personal. This requires innovative thinking which
        relates not only to aesthetic decisions, but activating the hearts and
        minds of your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work alongside artists and business to create unique identity design,
        including logo design, custom typography and illustration. This can be
        translated in limitless ways, but most often through packaging design,
        business cards, signage, publication, and online platforms. Find out
        more about the services I offer below.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Custom Typography</u></h3>
      <p>
        Typography is the primary tool to showcase your brands personality. As
        we examine the future of engaging, powerful and relevant branding, we
        can see typography being harnessed in unique and innovative ways.
        Successful branding utilises custom and bespoke typography to articulate
        a narrative which is distinctive, intentional, and uniquely their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the phrase ‘it’s not what you say but how you say it’. In the
        world of communication design this couldn’t be more true. Typography is
        your brand’s superpower. It will elevate any concept, project or
        business with the ability to speak for itself without the need to be
        explained by words.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Logo Design</u></h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most influential component of logo design is it’s ability to
        cultivate loyalty. When people begin to associate your logo with certain
        ideas, memories and emotions, your brand will have successfully set
        themselves apart and established an ongoing relationship with their
        consumer. As the foundation of your brand’s identity, your logo will
        promote trust, familiarity and recognition within your industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting the stage for the elements which make up your identity such as
        colours, tones and typography, your logo communicates an instant
        language which articulates your values, connects you to your community
        and asserts the quality of your business. Successful logo design will
        establish a marketable identity, a consistent brand experience and a
        convincing brand personality.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Illustration</u></h3>
      <p>
        Illustration has the ability to enrich a brands visual language and
        unfold a brand’s story beyond a preliminary brand mark. Whether it is
        used as a central part of your logo design or as an extension of your
        identity, illustrative elements help to reinforce the personality of
        your brand, and can be as distinctive to your design as the logo itself.
        Including illustration in your branding project will also broaden the
        possibilities of design choices when considering expanding your identity
        across other printed and digital media such as packaging, signage,
        websites and social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Businesses of all sizes can benefit greatly from the use of
        illustration, and it’s knack for simplifying complex concepts and
        enhancing key qualities and quirks of your brand’s identity, like
        playfulness, elegance or nostalgia.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Branding Manual</u></h3>
      <p>
        Consistency is everything when it comes to meaningful and memorable
        branding. A branding manual is an additional resource which will assist
        you in carrying out your branding successfully and consistently across
        all of your platforms. This will incorporate all of the new ingredients
        that make up your identity design, and act as a recipe for how to use
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elements included can vary between jobs, but typically incorporate your
        brand’s colour palette, fonts, imagery, tone of voice and messaging, as
        well as how your brand uses language and emotion to translate their
        identity. This will assist your brand in remaining recognisable,
        familiar and reliable in the eyes of your target audience, and ensure
        that you don’t confuse your consumers with an inconsistent narrative.

      <h1>Resume</h1>
      <p>Ellie is a freelance graphic designer based in Hobart, Tasmania.</p>
      <p>
        Putting her inclination to daydream to good use, Ellie’s adoration of
        fantasy growing up blossomed into a love of identity design, where
        daydreaming could now become her superpower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her experience of branding as a means to be transported to new places
        inspired her to launch her own career as a designer in 2017, after
        graduating her bachelors degree in Fine Arts at the University of
        Tasmania.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ellie’s practice focuses on projects which explore communication design
        outside the scope of current trends and delve into the individual quirks
        and personalities of her clients, giving her work an original and
        authentic quality that sets her apart her from others in the industry.
